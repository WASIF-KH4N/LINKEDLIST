# LINKEDLIST
This C++ code implements a simple linked list, consisting of four nodes with values 1, 2, 3, and 4. The program begins by declaring four node pointers, one, two, three, and four, and allocating memory for each node using the new keyword. The nodes are then connected by assigning the next pointer of each node to the subsequent node, with the last node's next pointer set to NULL to indicate the end of the list. Finally, the program traverses the linked list using a while loop, starting from the head node, and prints the value of each node to the console using cout. This code demonstrates the basic concept of a linked list, where each node points to the next node, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of nodes.
